# wordsearch
A website that allows you to play a word search puzzle, using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. 

A website word search game created in two days as a time limited project. 
Created with little knowledge of Javascript, using only online tools available to me.
Code is most likely a mess, considering I also had trouble looking through it.  

RUN: Download code and double click main.html!
NOTE: NOT PERFECT!! It is hard to highlight diagonal words, and the congratulation message is not flashy, nor does it have any css to it, and the same words can be repeated in the word bank, even if rare.
